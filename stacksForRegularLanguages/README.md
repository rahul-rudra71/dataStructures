# Stacks for Regular Languages 

## Project Description 
Identify 4 different regular languages utilizing only stacks and NO counting. The stack must be implemented using the files provided, not the library stack class. Use the provided files to  complete the project. L1 will only have A and B in char array, L2-L4 can have other letters in char array.

## Language Descriptions

L1 = contains equal numbers of A's and B's (in any order)  

L2 = is of the form A^nB^n, for some n > 0 (AABB, n = 2)

L3 = is of the form (A^nB^n)^p for some n,p > 0 (AABBAABB, n=2, p=2)

L4 = is of the form (A^nB^m)^p for some n,m,p > 0 (ABBABB, n=1, m=2, p=2)
