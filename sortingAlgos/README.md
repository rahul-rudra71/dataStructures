# Sorting Analysis

Implement three sorting routines of your choice. One must be not quadratic (e.g. quicksort, heapsort, mergesort, or shellsort).  Create input files of four sizes: 5000, 10000, 20000, and 50000 integers with one integer per line. For each size file make 3 versions. One version will be randomly ordered, one version will be in descending order, and one version will be in ascending order. This means you have a set of 12 input files. Run each sort against all input files. Thus, you will run average case, worst case (descending) and best case (ascending). For each run, access the system clock to get time values. The call to the clock should be placed as closely as possible to the beginning and end of each sort.
